## Ideas

* Side Scroller animal game
* Animal quiz
* Animal based puzzle game
* Calculator with animal facts based on number found

# Final Idea

My original idea (side scroller animal game) is out of my skill level, and also, I don't think it will fill all requirements. Instead, I will make a guesser quiz. The quiz will give an animal based question and four possible answers, the player must choose the correct answer then continue to the next question.

| Requirement | Application in Code |
| --- | --- |
| One list (or other collection type) | List of animal questions and answers |
| One procedure | Function to generate new questions after answering |
| Algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration | Function to determine if answer is correct |
| Calls to student developed procedure | calls to different procedures within procedures such as nextQuestion from a gameStart function |
| User Input | Answers given for each question |
| Instructions for output | Shows if submitted answer is correct or wrong |
