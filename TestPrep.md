## Weekly Actions

### 5.1 Actions

Beneficial/harmful effects of computing

Benefits

Increased efficiency in production of everyday goods which decreases costs, Decreased need for paper and paper products which saves trees, Increased productivity for general daily tasks ie; typing is faster than writing notes physically which increases productivity.

Harms

Creation of gambling/gacha games which makes it very easy for people to fall victim to gambling addiction, Easy to access illegal content which may facilitate crimes, requires lots of energy and manufacturing which may increase the amount of pollution

Dopamine issues?

Dopamine issues within our generations are definitely a real problem. With easy access to many things that can give you instant gratification, it can create too much constant dopamine. This would numb you to dopamine and require more to feel the same joys and highs you previously would, very similar to reactions when taking drugs. It creates a sort of addiction which can be linked back to computers and access to pretty much anything whenever you want

### 5.2 Actions

How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?

The digital world has access to so much info at once that you can empower yourself simply by learning from the massive amounts of data on the web. 

How to empower someone who is not empowered?

A way to help empower others is to teach. Take the info you’ve learned online and through the web to help others learn, especially if they don’t have access to those same resources you have. Even at Del Norte we can help empower others through teaching them how to better utilize and use their technology to its fullest capabilities

Is red tape blocking digital empowerment?

I think red tape does block digital empowerment often. Here at Del Norte we are pretty well off, the only red tape blocking us is the internet which sometimes blocks sites we could use for learning more about coding. For the most part it isn’t that bad though. HOwever in other places, there are likely lots of things preventing digital empowerment. All policies have to go through bureaucracy and so it may take time before other people are able to digitally empower themselves due to restrictions and blocks placed in front of them.

### 5.3 Actions

HP computers are racist?

Obviosuly, HP computers aren't racist. Objects like computers can't be racist, if anything the people who coded them mey have been, but it's more liekly that there is some mistake or problem that they did not see during testing. Perhaps they only tested facial recognition on certain peoples and that is why there is trouble identifying black people. It seems like a silly mistake that was made with no ill intent or harm meant behind it. It was simply a bug that was not found before release. It still should be fixed, and it is on the coders for not having a diverse enough testing group to find this problem, but it's very likely if my group were doing this same project, we would have overlooked these same problems. In order to produce a better outcome, the managers should've created a more diverse group of coders or testers so that the mistake would have been caught before reaching the public.

### 5.4 Actions

Crowd Sourcing Idea

One project we could make with crowdsourcing is a collection of birthdays. If everybody input their name and birthday, we could create  aprogram that automatically tells everyone happy birthday on the day. We could also create graphs and data of most common birthdays, zodiac signs and stuff like that.

Improvements on our project?

I think there are ways we could use crowdsourcing to improve out final website. For example, I think if we allowed people to edit and add to the calendar that we plan on putting in the website, that would be a good way to add info and dates that otehrs may want to see. Our project itself could be based on crowdsourced solutions to the tutorials as well so that others may look at previous solutions that coders have created before them for ideas and guidance on how to complete the tutorials themselves if they are having trouble.

### 5.6 Actions

I have seen PII in many places in our projects. The previous two trimesters we had about me pages specifically detailing personal info about our teams.Then during second tri we had the CRUD pages with names, phone numbers and emails of people. Even now, my menu function has a database function that contains some personal info about me like my name, date of birth and school email.

I don't like giving my PII out freely however I know that it already is all over the internet. And there's no way I could really prevent it. The info is already out there, so if someone wants it they can find it regardless. So I don't really mind the small amounts of data I provide on our projects.

I've heard the strongest passwords are made up of four unrelated words strung together with capitols for the start of each word as well. Most peope don't make passwrods like these though. A strong password should have lower case, capitols, numbers and symbols, and should be long. A weak password may not have all of these things. Or if your password is some kind of identifiable info like your birthdate or last name, it would be considered a very poor password. 2FA is used to make your accounts harder to break as well. If you are logging in from a new device, you may receive an email with a one time use code, or you may be required to answer a personal question, with info that isn't readily available online.

Symmetric encryption is when you use a single key to both encrypt and decrypt your information. This means it would be easier to gain access to due to only needing one key to fully access the info
Asymmetric encryption is when you use two different keys, one to encrypt the data and then a second different key in order to decrypt that info.

An example of encryption that we have used in our deployment is HTTPS. The secured part encrypts data on the website for a more secure way of transferring data.

Some phishing techniques I have seen and experienced include many people pretending to be different companies requesting some sort of login info so that they may 'assist' with some problem in your account. These false emails want some baseline to your personal info or account info so that they may break into your account. Another phishing attempt may give a link to what seems like a trustworthy website, however when you click on the link, it automatically downloads malware or viruses on to your device. These programs often search your computer for data or personal info as well.
